	<h1 class="demo-title">What is BasePost?</h1>
	<p class="u-line-length">BasePost is intended to be used as a starting point for CSS developers building medium to large projects using PostCSS. It's not a UI framework, just a tool to help speed up the development process while still encouraging high quality, maintainable codebases.</p>

			<h3 class="demo-callout__title">Flexible</h3>
			<p class="margin-b-0">BasePost is made to mold to your wishes. Quickly tweak the feel of an entire project by changing a few variables.</p>

			<h3 class="demo-callout__title">Responsive</h3>
			<p class="margin-b-0">Breakpoints respond to not only screen width, but also zooming and user-set font size. Type scales automatically adjust for smaller and larger screens.</p>

    <h2 class="demo-title--1">Structure</h2>
    <p class="u-line-length">BasePost incorporates ideas from <a href="http://itcss.io/">ITCSS</a>, OOCSS, and BEM in it's organization. It's built with the CSS cascade, source order and specificity in mind. Although it comes pre-structured, it is still easy to chose what direction to take your project in, whether you feel more comfortable with OOCSS, Atomic CSS, SMACSS, or whatever else.</p>
