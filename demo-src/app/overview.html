	<p class="u-line-length">BasePost is intended to be used as a starting point for building the css for medium to large projects using PostCSS. It includes normalization/reset, sensible defaults, useful layout, utility, and override classes, and more optional modules to get a project up and running quickly. It is responsive by default and gives you the power to change a lot with just a few variables, while at the same time being neutral enough to get in the way.</p>
	<p class="u-line-length">It's intended to be a tool to help <em>write</em> your css, not a catch-all framework to build a website with out-of-the-box.</p>

    <p class="u-line-length">BasePost is built with responsiveness in mind. It responds not only to window size, but also base font size and allows a different modular type scale for mobile and desktop</p>
