        <p class="demo-copy">BasePost is intended to be used as a starting point for building the css for medium-large projects using PostCSS. It includes normalization/reset, sensible defaults, useful layout and utility classes, and more optional modules to get a project up and running quickly. It is responsive by default and gives you the power to change a lot with just a few variables, while at the same time being neutral enough to get in the way.</p>
        <p class="demo-copy">It's intended to be a tool to help <em>write</em> your css, not a catch-all framework to build a website with out-of-the-box.</p>
        <section class="demo-section">
            <h2 class="demo-section__title">Responsive</h2>
            <p class="demo-copy">BasePose uses em and rem units for many of the basic variables and defaults. Because of this, layout and spacing can easily respond to changes in the base font size along with typography. This, coupled with the fact that it purposefully does not set a base font-size also makes the breakpoints scale acessibly for users who set a different font-size in their browser. You can see more details in the Typography section of the settings page.</p>
